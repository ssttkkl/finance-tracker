# Specification Quality Checklist: Fact Field Unification

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-07-24  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Validation after clarify session 2026-07-24: Pass (16/16).
- Locked: physical renames (`description`→`note`, `kind`→`action`); strip cores from payload; public headers break to catalog; fail-closed conflicts; **one-shot cutover, no compatibility shims**.
- Dual-backend and migration mentioned only as constitution-required persistence behavior, not stack design.
- Ready for `/speckit-plan`.
